- This is a very simple ruler for iOS, that just does what it should do.
- We created this when we saw the variety of terrible, ouf-of-date, old-fashioned ruler apps out there and didn't find anything simple just suiting our needs.
- It's available on the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ruling-ruler/id1248931289) right now, so go ahead and download it there if you don't want to install it yourselves.
- The App Store version has Fabric & Crashlytics built-in, but both apikey and buildsecret aren't included in this repository (*you guess why? ;)*). You may however see some warnings reminding you to add these for any release â€“ those are irrelevant to you.
